(feat. Dwele)
[VERSE 1:]
She don't believe in shootin stars
But she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartement

Courtois from the store's departments

You more like love to start shit

I'm more of the, trips to Flor-i-da

Order the hors d'oeuvres, views of the waters

Straight from a page of your favorite author

And the weather's so breezy

Man, why can't life always be this easy

She in the mirror, dancin so sleazy

I get a call like "Where are you Yeezy?"

I try to hit you with the [?]old and wafty[?]

Till I got flashed by the Papparazzi

Damn, these niggaz got me

I hate these niggaz more than a Nazi



[CHORUS:]

As I recall I know you love to show off

But I never thought that you would take it this far

But what do I know

What do I know



[VERSE 2:]

I know it's been a while sweetheart, we hardly talk

I was doin my thing

I know it was foul baby every day lately

You've been all on my brain

And if somebody would've told me a month ago

Frontin though, yo I wouldn't wanna know

If somebody would've told me a year ago

It'd go get this difficult

Feelin like Katrina with no FEMA

Like Martin with no Gina

Like a flight with no VISA

First class with the seat back, I still see ya

In my past, you on the other side of the glass

Of my memory's museum, I'm just sayin

Hey Mona Lisa come home, you know you can't Rome without Ceasar



[CHORUS:]

As I recall I know you love to show off

But I never thought that you would take it this far

But what do I know

What do I know

As you recall you know I love to show off

But you never thought that I would take it this far

But what do you know

What do you know
