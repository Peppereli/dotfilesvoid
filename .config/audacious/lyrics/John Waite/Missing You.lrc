Everytime I think of you I always catch my breath And I'm still standing here and you're miles away and I'm wonderin' why you´re left ...and there's a storm that's raging through my frozen heart tonight... I hear your name in certain circles and it always makes me smile I spend my time thinkin' about you and it's almost driving me wild ...and there's a heart that's breaking down this long distance line tonight... I ain't missing you at all since you've been gone away I ain't missing you no matter ...what I might say There's a message in the wire and I'm sending you this signal tonight You don't know how desperate I've become and it looks like I'm losing this fight In your world I have no meaning though I'm trying hard to understand ...and it's my heart that's breaking down this long distance line tonight... I ain't missing you at all since you've been gone away I ain't missing you no matter ...what my friends say ...and there's a message that I'm sending out like a telegraph to your soul... ...and if I can't bridge this distance - stop this heartbreak overload !!! I ain't missing you at all since you've been gone away I ain't missing you no matter ...what my friends say I ain't missing you... I ain't missing you... I keep liein´ to myself ! ...and there's a storm that's raging through my frozen heart tonight... I ain't missing you at all since you've been gone ...away I ain't missing you no matter ...what my friends say Ain't missing you ... I ain't missing you I ain't missing you I bee lie to myself Ain't missing you, I ain't missing you I ain't missing you, I ain't missing you I ain't missing you, I ain't missing you, ain't missing you, oh no No matter what my friends might say, I ain't missing you...
