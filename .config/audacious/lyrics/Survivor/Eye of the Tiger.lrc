Risin' up
back on the street
did my time took my chances
went the distance
now i'm back on my feet
just a man and his will to survive

so many times

it happens too fast

you trade your passion for glory

don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past

you must fight just to keep them alive



It's the eye of the tiger

it's the thrill of the fight

risin' up to the challenge of our rival

and the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night

and he's watchin us all with the eye

of the tiger



Face to face

out in the heat

hangin' tough

stayin' hungry

they stack the odds

still we take to the street

for the kill with the skill to survive



It's the eye of the tiger

it's the thrill of the fight

risin' up to the challenge of our rival

and the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night

and he's watchin us all with the eye

of the tiger



Risin' up

straight to the top

had the guts

got the glory

went the distance

now i'm not gonna stop

just a man and his will to survive



It's the eye of the tiger

it's the thrill of the fight

risin' up to the challenge of our rival

and the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night

and he's watchin us all with the eye

of the tiger
