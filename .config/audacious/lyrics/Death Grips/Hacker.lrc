Goin' back to Tangier
With some jordans and a spear
Post-Christian shit
Post chicken or the egg addiction shit
Pass the sherm stick
Neo-reality

Be the freak you wanna see

Just don't follow me

I'm on a journey to the center of three

Grab your fucking chain and drag you through the bike lane

While everybody's like no



I got this pregnant snake

Stay surrounded by long hairs

A plethora of maniacs and spiral stairs

Make your water break in the apple store

Sink or swim, who fucking cares

Cut the birth cords, press send

Yeah thick

Gaga can't handle this shit



Headed for the Sammy Davis wing

Throw up a black hole at the entrance of linens n things on the way

Never call it a day

Visit Tesla's grave for the ninth time today

Still on the way

Bigger wigs



(When you come out your shit is gone) [x4]

I'm in your area, I'm in your area [x2]

I know the first three numbers, I'm in [x2]

I'm in your area, I'm in your area [x2]

I know the first three numbers, I'm in [x2]

When you come out your shit is gone [x2]

I'm in

When you come out your shit is gone [x2]



You'll catch a jpeg to the head, Ã¼ber reach

You're an intern on Wiki Leaks

Most loved therefore most hated

Come and knock on the door we've been waiting for you

Game changer

Reclusive aggressive

Yinging and yanging noided

Info warrior jack the hacker

The rolling stoner

Profit on disaster



My existence is a momentary lapse of reason

Got the DNA of Gothic lemons

Shred it thirteen times out of eleven

Your bad ideas are the ATM

Shed my skin

Leave it for the homeless to sleep it

Prodigal, fuck that nautical

Teachin' bitches how to swim



I'm in your area, I'm in your area [x2]

I know the first three numbers, I'm in [x2]

I'm in your area, I'm in your area [x2]

I know the first three numbers, I'm in [x2]

(Teachin' bitches how to swim) [x2]

I'm in

(Teachin' bitches how to swim) [x2]



Now backstroke

Through your k-hole

Don't run

Ya might slip

The table's flipped now we got all the coconuts bitch



Burmese babies under each arm

Screamin' beautiful songs

The cray cray ultra contrarion

Havin' conversations with your car alarm

When you come out your shit is gone

Soon your crew will be servin' sandwiches named after me

Vietnamese style fool, please



Front row at the mass games

Untraceable by name

You speak of us in certain circles you will be dethroned or detained

Gone, gone

Your shit is gone, gone

When you come out your shit is gone



I'm in your area, I'm in your area [x2]

I know the first three numbers, I'm in [x2]

I'm in your area, I'm in your area [x2]

I know the first three numbers, I'm in [x2]
