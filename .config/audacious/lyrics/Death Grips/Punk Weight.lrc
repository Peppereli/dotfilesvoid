Hot shit, cold shit
OK muthafucka let's do this
Came ta make it band sawed off razor edge maintained looseness
Comin' through, again and again conduit
Why dem hands wave to
High to it

Wild fire through your city

Wild fire through your whip me

Into lightning two

Can't hit three

Strikes dug out dated

Fools no dig me

End beat limbo, baba spitting

Blood in slow mo, la la chimney



Warholian nightmare

Storm the gates

25 8, twelve gauge pun2k weight



(25 8 pun2k weight out yo flesh)



Stick and move, leave no proof

Discard directly after use

Forensics on that wild goose

Follow my footprints into loops



Cause I'm too high, too high

Cause I'm too high, too high

Feel like I'm never ever

Gonna come down

Scale Richter pun2k weight

Of dis sound

Scale Richter pun2k weight

Of dis sound



Down break dead space

And make it drop

Ta da street beneath

Your ghetto box

Slap da beat till the

Floor boards crack

Neath da weight of dis lic, step back



Off in the rhythm like

Beta in the bong

Got ta give em make em

Sway like palms

In da wind my lip blow

Mic spray kyrlon

25 8 til da break of dawn



(War war)



Guerrilla bass, straight from the trenches,

Posers impaled on picket fences...

How ta rest your head in roach infested

Basements and smoke pun2k weight for breakfast...

Chop shop lifted bump til da tape deck break,

Ask Samo how he flipped that material girls pancakes...

As zydeco copper kettles



Liquor sto, sellin' singles

Mug shots out, to my people

Rollin I double l spread eagle

Hear flow dan spit evil



(25 8 pun2k weight out yo flesh)
