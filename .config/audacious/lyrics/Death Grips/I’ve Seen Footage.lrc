What's that
Can't tell
Hand held dream
Shot in hell
Deep space ghetto (streets)
Show me somethin'

I ain't seen before

Mystery hind that

Death door

Juke step electrocute the floor

What's the science on

Flyin' that high

Got a no-no goin', one time



Creeps up behind me

Over my shoulder

Turn around try to see

But it's nowhere

Noided, noided

Static on my blindside



I seen footage, I stay noided... I seen footage [repeat]



Everybody's knowin'

Where ya think you're goin' ain't goin' nowhere

Satellite, handle that

With a lead pipe



Who captures life

Who takes what's left who stay

On that next, already know my gillicutti, like I told you...

Don't touch me

What's up with it

I stay noided, stimulation overload account for it

Desensitized by the mass amounts of shit



I've seen it, I've been it

Can't delete it feels like jail (noided)

Full moon in da klink shinin' don't sleep

Surveillance post my bail



I seen footage, I stay noided... I seen footage [repeat]



Armored cop open fire Glock

On some kid who stepped so

Fast was hard to grasp

What even happened til you seen dat head blow

Off his shoulders in slow mo

Rewind that, is so cold

Rewind that, is so cold

I seen footage... I stay noided



Juke step with so much boy rude looseness seem like no bones in his skin

(Noided) my jaw hit da floor like this real for I gotta see that one mo gin



Ambulance hit and run over pedestrian in Brazil

Little tiger, boy soldier

Twist a cap back and kills (noided)



Seen crazy shit, man crazy shit...



I seen footage, I stay noided... I seen footage [repeat]
