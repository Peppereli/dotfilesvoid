[ Ives ]
Es la vida, quatro vente pistos pointed
Botella empty first ten rows annointed
The fiesta's poppin and all fingers pointed
Irie eyed vatos got the whole crowd jointed
Check in with Ives catch me squintin know why
I came be let my word fly keep the
gleam in your eye (ha!)
Con mucho drum roll on time let the horn blow
Gas to the pedal like metal at a KoRn show
The rhyme rocka with a shit load of placas
Grab the mic and freak the rhythm
till there's no more balas
Still mis palabras fade all boo's and ha-ha's
That includes all who go sissy la-la
So do the cha-cha, ruka call me poppa
Huero came for action hun until mañana
Down for hi-hat crash and whiplash
City nights bright lights and herb stash...

Chorus

[ Kemo ]
Que ondas muchacho, arriba las manos
Gavacho, moreno penetra tu barrio
Lacing you with rolas that will rock back frente
RRRRRR, Blaxican esto pa la gente
Like chanclazos deep like fregadazos
Still got the Coke and Rum and flex the brazos
Then I hit you from a different angle
Leg sweep cheap shot bird shit straight cop
Soy el Twin Pistolero, guerrero don't be afraid of that
Matter of fact, I got like 10,000 maniacs
In the crowd on a very good night
But keep it hype for a fraction of
that, to get the fery like that
Chronica en el aire, todos quieren baile
Plus my sick Latin sty'le
Caile, chueco as they come
I could feel the drum don't know the
words, well you can hum...

Chorus

[ Kemo ]
Oye muñeca ya mueve las caderas
Sobre el ritmo y las trompetas
Feel the beat kick hard como escopeta
Vatos on the prowl for the hoochie lookin fresca
All you delinquentes vengan para en frente
Hazte para atrás si tu eres muy decente
Cause I'm chueco ven contact the yerba
Lo que será será cuando lo envuelva

[ Ives ]
A little sontin gets your eyes burnt head turnt
Pupils tight back stiff and your
neck hurt and then you exert
Check the vibe who got more freaky than Ives
I survive, dodgin hootta tryin to shoot I
So I mueva smooth creep and crawl
Take out another batch let it thaw and lace y'all
Won't take fall this here is winner take all
Trick take a flick of the click here to face y'all...

Chorus
