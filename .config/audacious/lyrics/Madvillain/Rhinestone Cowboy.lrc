Hold the cold one
Like he hold the old gun
Like he hold the microphone
And stole the show for fun
Or a foe for ransom
Flows is handsome

O's in tandem

Anthem, random, tantrum

Phantom of the Grand Old Opry ask the dumb hottie

Masked pump shottee

Somebody stop me

Hardly come sloppy on a retarded hard copy

After rockin' parties he departed in a jalopy



Watch the droptop pop

Known as the grimy limey slimy

Try me blimey

Simply smashing in a fashion that's timely

Mad Villain dashing in a beat rhyme crime spree

We rock the house like rock 'n roll

Got more soul

Than a sock with a hole

Set the stage with a goal

To have the game locked in a cage

Getting shocked with a pole

Overthrow like throwing rover a viscuit

A lot of bitches think he's overly chauvanistic

Let go his dick if that's the case

Rats, what a waste

More cats to chase

Dogs he got 'em like new powers

Woke up, wrote and spit the shit in a few hours

Sheesh! Been unleashed since the glee club

Had your fam saying please make me a dub

Well, since you ask kindly

Where he been behind the mask

Who can't find me?

You're blind in the wine zone

Leave ya mind blown when he shine with the 9

He's a rhinestone...cowboy



Goony goo goo loony koo-koo like Gary Gnu off New Zoo Review

But who knew the mask had a loose screw?

Hell, could hardly tell

Had to tighten it up

Like the Drells and Archie Bell

It speaks well of the hyper bass

Wasn't even tweaked and it leaked into cyberspace

Couldn't wait for the snipes to place

At least a track list in bold print typeface

Stopped for a year

Come back with thumb tacks

Pop for the beer, we're hip hop sharecroppers

Used to wear flip flops, now rare gear coppers

He's in this for the quiche

You might as well not ask for no free shit, capiche?



Oh my aching hands

From raking in grands and breakin in mic stands

Villain-his smile stuns ya chick

While he puts himself in your shoes

Run ya kicks

You heard it on the radio-tape it

Play it in your stereo your crew'll go apeshit

Raw lyrics-he smells 'em like a hunch

The same intuition that tells who spiked the punch



Curses

He's truly the worsest

With enough rhymes to spread

Throughout the boundless universes

Let the beat blast

She told him wear the mask

He said you bet your sweet ass

Its made of fine chrome alloy

Find him on the grind

He's the rhinestone...cowboy
