Two cigarettes in an ashtray
My love and i, in a small caf? br&amp;gt; then a stranger came along
And everything went wrong
Now there's three cigarettes in the ashtray

I watched her take him from me


And his love is no longer my own
Now they are gone
And I sit alone
And watch one cigarette burn away

(repeat last verse)
