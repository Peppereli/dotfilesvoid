[Verse 1]
Now
The mist across the window hides the lines
But nothing hides the color of the lights that shine
Electricity so fine
Look and dry your eyes

[Verse 2]
We
So tired of all the darkness in our lives
With no more angry words to say can come alive
Get into a car and drive
To the other side

[Chorus]
Me babe, steppin' out
Into the night
Into the light
You babe, steppin' out
Into the night
Into the light

[Verse 3]
We
Are young but getting old before our time
We'll leave the T.V. and the radio behind
Don't you wonder what we'll find
Steppin' out tonight?

[Verse 4]
You
Can dress in pink and blue just like a child
And in a yellow taxi turn to me and smile
We'll be there in just a while
If you follow me

[Chorus]
Me babe, steppin' out
Into the night
Into the light
You babe, steppin' out
Into the night
Into the light

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Me babe, steppin' out
Into the night
Into the light
You babe, steppin' out
Into the night
Into the light
Me babe, steppin' out
Into the night
Into the light
