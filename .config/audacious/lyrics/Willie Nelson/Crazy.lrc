I'm crazy
crazy for feeling so lonely
I'm crazy
crazy for feeling so blue

I know
you'd love me as long as you wanted
then someday
leave me for somebody new

(bridge)
worry
why do I let myself worry
wondring
what in the world did I do

crazy
for thinking that my love could hold you
I'm crazy for crying
I'm crazy for trying
I'm crazy for loving you
